# Next-Word-Predictor
This project contains the code with a GUI interface in a jupyter notebook , It takes a sentence as a input and outputs top 3 next predicted words which could inserted in the original sentence . Hence , making typing time efficient and increases speed.

I used GPT-2 transformer model and trained it on training datasets , and final performance metrices were calculated on test datatsets.
For GUI Interface functions of Tkinter library were used  

A video showing working of my model is also attached in the rep , kindly check that out!

The perplexity of model was - 1.52
Its top 5 accuracy was - 95.23%
